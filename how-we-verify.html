<h1>How BeautyJar Verifies Providers</h1>

<p>
BeautyJar is a verification-based provider network designed to help patients identify qualified professionals in women's health, medical weight management, hormone care, and aesthetic medicine.
</p>

<p>
Our verification process focuses on confirming professional standing and practice legitimacy so that patients can make informed decisions when selecting care.
</p>

<h2>Verification Includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Active professional license verification</li>
    <li>Identity confirmation</li>
    <li>Practice legitimacy review</li>
    <li>Ongoing monitoring and annual review</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>
BeautyJar verification confirms that a provider meets baseline professional and operational standards at the time of review. Verification does not constitute a guarantee of clinical outcomes or quality of care.
</p>

<h2>Public Verification Framework</h2>

<p>
BeautyJar’s verification methodology is documented as a versioned public framework to support transparency and accountability.
